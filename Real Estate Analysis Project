Real Estate Analysis Project

Project 1 for UNCC FinTech Boot Camp

Description

In this project I am using Python code to demonstrate how a real estate investor may be able to use code for housing comparisons to make the best informed investment decision. 

They will be able to manipulate this notebook using a housing market API such as the Zillow API included in this project. the user can also manipulate housing setting such as the city, state, bed and bathroom count, housing cost minimium and maximum, rental/ owned properties, and square footage, and more. These settings will collect data from Zillow and allow you to compare multiple properties at one time; cutting down comp analysis time.


The API included in this project of from RapidAPI under the Zillow.com option, in the /propertyExtendedSearch (Extended search) option. If you scroll through this tab you will see all the different options this API offers for data analysis.
